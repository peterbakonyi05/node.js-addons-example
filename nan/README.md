# [Node.js addons examples - Using nan](https://github.com/workshopper/goingnative)

The Native Abstractions for Node.js (or nan) provide a set of tools that Addon developers are recommended to use 
to keep compatibility between past and future releases of V8 and Node.js.

## Install, build, run
* `npm i` (install local packages)
* `npm i -g node-gyp` (install node-gyp globally)
* `node-gyp configure build` (compile C++ addons)
* `node src/example-name.js` (try out one of the examples)

## Examples
* Check out the src folder :)
